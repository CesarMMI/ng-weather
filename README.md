# NgWeather

This is a portfolio project built with Angular that showcases the integration of external APIs to create a dynamic and visually appealing weather app.  

- [**Weather API**](https://openweathermap.org/api) for real-time weather data
- [**Unsplash API**](https://unsplash.com/developers) for dynamic background images

This project demonstrates API integration, reactive programming with Angular, and UI/UX design principles. ðŸš€
